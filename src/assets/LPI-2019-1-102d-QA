Explanation::
centos 7 man page zu nmcli:
wifi connect (B)SSID [password password] [wep-key-type {key | phrase}] [ifname ifname]
[bssid BSSID] [name name] [private {yes | no}] [hidden {yes | no}]
Connect to a Wi-Fi network specified by SSID or BSSID.

    		  The command finds a matching connection
    						or
    	=>=> creates one and then activates it on a device.

    		  This is a command-line counterpart of clicking an SSID in a GUI client. If a connection
    		  for the network already exists, it is possible to bring up (activate) the existing profile
    		  as follows: nmcli con up id name.
    	=>=> Note that only open, WEP and WPA-PSK networks are supported
    				if no previous connection exists.
    				It is also assumed that IP configuration is obtained via DHCP.

    demnach ist Antwort C hier richtig, sollte es noch nicht bekannt, aber existieren!
    Ist das Wifi Netzwerk mit Passwort geschützt muß diese dann dazu angegeben werden,
    wobei dies beim Ausführen des Kommandos als User angefragt wird. Insofern muss man

das Passwort auch nicht dem Kommando mitgeben. Angelegt wird tatsächlich eine
entsprechende Komfigurationsdatei mit zugeordnete Keydatei und das Interface aktiviert!

Vormals alte, als richtig erachtete Antwort:
bezogen auf die gegebene Fragestellung und der gegebenen Anworten
ist nur D richtig!
wenn WIFIoI nicht existiert => error!

    wenn WIFIoI existiert, man könnte vermuten
    das C richtig wäre, da dieses Kommando auch eine entsprechende
    Konfigurationsdatei anlegt! - AP muss also existieren und es wird
    auch die Aktivierung der Verbindung versucht. Da aber z.B. kein Passwort
    angegeben ist, ist es sehr fraglich, wie eigentlich der AP
     konfiguriert ist. In der Regel ist die Aktivierung daher nicht möglich,
    daher C = falsch.

Ergänzung, warum aber C richtig ist: die Fehlermeldung gibs es nur beim Ausführen
des Kommandos unter root. Als User ausgeführt wird das Passwort
angefragt und bei richtigem Passwort eine Konfigurationsdatei und
zugehörige Passwort (key) Datei angelegt, sowie das Interface aktiviert!

Explanation::
Zunächst vermutete richtige Antwort:
A - aber nur für debian/ubuntu
debian/ubuntu etc : A - ist erlaubt
bei RHEL/SEL/Fedora/CentOS wäre A falsch, weil da User dann cron nicht nutzen können!
B ist falsch: "root legt keine spezifischen crontabs für einen User an, wenn man
damit jeweils entsprechende User-Dateien meint.

Neue richtige Antwort:
B ist richtig:
ABER: - außer es wird die globale /etc/crontab benutzt, wo root user spezifische
crontab Einträge vornehmen kann, z.B für System spezifische Services, die
nicht unter root laufen sollen! DANN WÄRE B RICHTIG :) und dies
gilt für alle Linux System gleichermaßen, also keine Unterschied ob
Debian/Ubuntu etc. oder RHEL/SLES/Suse/Fedora/RockuLinux/Centos etc.
